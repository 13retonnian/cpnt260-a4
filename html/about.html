    This page is about building a civilization on the moon. If you create the civilization and click the build button then nothing will happen. 
    At this point you may become disappointed. This may actually just be something designed to disappoint you. I didn't do that on purpose, sorry.
    Actually maybe it just builds it in your imagination. Yes this is an imagination exercise, you're welcome. 
    The nav bar on the top points to other cool stuff.
